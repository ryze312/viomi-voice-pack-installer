Voice pack installer for Viomi STYT02JYM
It is entirely possible, where are other models, that support this method.
So far I tested it only on STYT02JYM.
Report to me if this also works on other models.

If at any stage script fails, you will be advised to reconnect device.
Increasing MAX_TIMEOUT in main.py can also help.

Voice packs for STYT02JYM can be downloaded here:

Before launching script, install dependencies with install.bat or install.sh
All packs by default go into "Packs" directory, change PACK_DIR variable if you wish to use different path
