Voice pack replacer for Viomi STYT02JYM
It is entirely possible, where are other models, that support this method.
So far I tested it only on STYT02JYM.
Report to me if this also works on other models.

If at any stage script fails, you will be advised to reconnect device.
Increasing MAX_TIMEOUT in main.py can also help.


Voice packs for STYT02JYM can be downloaded here:
